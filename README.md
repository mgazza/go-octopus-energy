# go-octopus-energy

## Overview
`go-octopus-energy` is a Go client library for interacting with Octopus Energy's API. This library facilitates communication with Octopus Energy services and integrates seamlessly with its tariffs and products.

## OpenAPI Specification
The Octopus Energy API is documented as an OpenAPI 3.0 specification, which serves as the basis for generating the client code. The source of the OpenAPI spec is available at:

[https://api.octopus.energy/v1/schema?namespaces=default](https://api.octopus.energy/v1/schema?namespaces=default)

## Generating the Client Code
The client code is generated using [Go Swagger](https://goswagger.io/), a toolkit for generating Go client libraries from Swagger/OpenAPI specifications.

### Prerequisites
To generate the client code, you need to have Docker installed and accessible from your system. The generation process uses the `swagger` CLI from the `quay.io/goswagger/swagger` Docker image.

### Setting Up an Alias for Swagger
To simplify usage, you can set up an alias for running Swagger with Docker. Add the following line to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` file:

```bash
alias swagger='docker run --rm -it --user $(id -u):$(id -g) -e GOPATH=$(go env GOPATH):/go -v $HOME:$HOME -w $(pwd) quay.io/goswagger/swagger'
```

Reload your shell configuration:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc  # or source ~/.bashrc
```

### Generating the Client
With the alias in place, you can generate the client code by running:

```bash
swagger generate client -f octopus-swagger.yaml
```

The generated client code will be written to the current directory.

### About the OpenAPI Conversion
The Octopus Energy API is originally in OpenAPI 3.0 format. To use it with Go Swagger, it is first converted to Swagger 2.0 format using the [api-spec-converter](https://github.com/LucyBot-Inc/api-spec-converter):

```bash
api-spec-converter --from=openapi_3 --to=swagger_2 --syntax=yaml octopus-spec.yaml > octopus-swagger.yaml
```

After conversion, some manual tweaks are applied to the output file for compatibility and correctness.

## `generate.go`
The `generate.go` file is responsible for automating the client generation process using Go's `go:generate` directive. Here is the relevant content:

To run the code generation process, use:

```bash
go generate ./generate.go
```

This will invoke the `swagger` CLI to generate the client based on the `octopus-swagger.yaml` file.
